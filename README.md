# JsonParser
Project on delivering insights to the end user via the Json generated via Restapi

PipeLine Define:-
1) We have a JSON file that has been provided by the Client. The JSON consist of a Tree like structure which needs to be parsed and then based on the Tree we will be fetching more data from the user servernet.
2) Along side, we will have a Python funnel which will process the parsed data and create meaningful insight using Panda. We will also be using Python to carry out the query request for further data.
